#### Project Goals

The main purpose of this project is to develop a smart and efficient online appointment booking system that offers a seamless experience for patients and users. With a focus on overcoming the challenges of manual appointment management, the web-based application aims to simplify the process of scheduling doctor's appointments. The current system can often become cumbersome for compounders or doctors as they manually allocate appointments based on availability, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors. This project aims to provide an effective solution where users can easily view various available booking slots across three clinic areas and select their preferred date and time. By utilizing a user-friendly interface, the system will mark already booked spaces in yellow, preventing double booking for the specified time. Additionally, the system incorporates a cancellation feature, allowing users to modify their appointments as needed. The project's primary goal is to enhance the overall appointment booking experience, offering convenience and flexibility while reducing the administrative burden for medical staff.



#### Project Scope

The scope of this project encompasses the development of a comprehensive smart appointment booking system that consists of several key modules. The system will have an administrative login that allows authorized personnel to manage the bookings made by users effectively. Users will need to register to access the system, which will provide them with personalized login credentials. The application will offer three clinic areas in different locations, providing users with options for their appointments. Users can check appointment availability by clicking on the available spaces in the calendar. Upon selecting a suitable date and time, users can proceed to book their appointments online, with the system automatically calculating the total cost based on the chosen time duration. To ensure flexibility, the project will include a booking cancellation feature, enabling users to cancel their appointments through the system at any time. Moreover, the system will send confirmation and gratitude emails to users upon successful appointment bookings. To gather valuable feedback, the application will feature a dedicated feedback form for users to share their thoughts and experiences. The project's scope emphasizes user convenience, efficient booking processes, and overall system reliability, aiming to create a smart appointment booking system that optimizes the appointment scheduling workflow for both users and medical professionals.
